I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/) in São Paulo, Brazil.

My main research project currently examines the potential effects of a policy intended to reduce domestic violence on women's labor market outcomes. This research in [financed](http://bv.fapesp.br/pt/bolsas/207019/) by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

I have a broad interest in topics of development economics with a focus on education, labor, and political economy.
