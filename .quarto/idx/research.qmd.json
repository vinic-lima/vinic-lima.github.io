While the primary objective is combatting domestic violence, it also redistributes bargaining power to women, placing them in a stronger position to implement their preferred allocation. The main finding indicates that a 60\\\\% decrease in the average distance of married women to a police station would lead to a 2.7\\\\% increase in their participation in the labor market. The effects are primarily driven by educated women, who are likely to have higher initial bargaining power. I show supporting evidence of reduced women's hospitalization due to violence and that reporting of crimes related to domestic violence responded consistently. These findings shed light on the interplay between law enforcement, household dynamics, and labor market outcomes.\n\n### **Peer Effects in Active Learning**\n\nwith Vladimir Ponczek and Priscilla Tavares\n\nThis paper studies peer effects in higher education by observing students in an environment of *active learning*, where peer interaction is a meaningful mechanism explaining performance. The identification of peer effects relies on the random assignment of students to groups of different disciplines and explores variation both in terms of the share of low and high-ability students in each group as well as the frequency that peers meet for group work. The first result is that the share of low and high-ability peers in a group is not able to explain by itself the existence of positive peer effects on performance, which arises only when we consider the fraction of a student's high-ability peers in the group that are also his peers in a second group. We show that when pairs of students meet in more than one group, they are more likely to establish a link, measured by students' self-reported naming of their relevant peers. Thus, increased interaction with high-ability peers impacts positively performance.\n\n### **Tit-for-Tat between Legislative and Executive**\n\nwith Eduardo Ferraz and Lucas Finamor\n\nIn this paper, we look to elections and local governments in Brazil to analyze how the interplay between the executive and legislative powers affects governance. With new data on budget management and a microfounded definition of close proportional elections, we identify the causal effect of stronger legislative support on governance. Our findings highlight that the legislative-executive relationship interacts with electoral incentives in shaping how mayors use increased support. Under the possibility of reelection, mayors seem to use the flexibility they gain from more support to make a better government and improve their reputation. With no reelection incentives, though, mayors prioritize rent extraction.\n\n### **Electoral Coalitions and Political Competition**\n\nwith Eduardo Ferraz\n\nThis paper studies the impact of a reform that limited the maximum number of candidates in electoral coalitions disputing local legislative elections in Brazil. The reform targeted municipalities with more than 100,000 voters, allowing us to use a difference-in-differences design to estimate its effects on the entry of candidates and political selection. The reform increased political competition by raising the number of effective coalitions by 12.2%. This attracted better-educated candidates and consequently elected legislators were 34.5% richer, on average. No significant change was found in the amount of money spent in the election. However, there is modest evidence that resources were redirected to the legislative elections. Finally, although there is a 4% increase in total revenues we find no effect on policy spending. These results provide evidence of a causal link between electoral rules and political selection through a rearrangement of electoral coalitions.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"research.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"simplex","fontsize":"0.9em"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
