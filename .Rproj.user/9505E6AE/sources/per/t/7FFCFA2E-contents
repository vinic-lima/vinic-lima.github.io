In this paper, I use Brazilian data to investigate the effects of a law aimed at tackling domestic violence on women's labor market participation in a difference-indifferences framework. The law increased the probability of punishment of DV perpetrators, and the paper's main hypothesis is that it improved women's negotiating position within households, leading to a redistribution of bargaining power in favor of them. The identification strategy leverages spatial heterogeneity in the access to police stations, the first step into the justice system.

The paper's main finding shows that after the policy, married women living at an average distance of 2.7 km from a police station (the 90th percentile) would have experienced a 2.9% increase in their labor market participation rate had they lived at an average of 1.1 km (the 10th percentile). I show supporting evidence of reduced women's hospitalization due to violence and that reporting of crimes related to domestic violence responded consistently.

In this paper, we study peer effects in higher education by observing students in an active learning environment, where peer interaction is a meaningful mechanism for explaining performance. Identification of peer effects relies on the random assignment of students to groups and leverages random variation in group average ability level and the frequency that peers meet for group work. This allows us to highlight the importance of peer interaction in explaining peer effects.

We show that replacing a high-ability peer with a low-ability one in the group implies an average increase of 10.5% of a standard deviation in the performance of low-ability students, while for high-ability students, this same replacement causes an average decrease of 5.1% of a standard deviation in performance. The reduction in the average ability of peers drives the positive effect on the performance of low-ability students. \[update\]
